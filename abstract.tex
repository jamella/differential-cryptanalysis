In this paper we discuss the mathematics behind attacking a Block Cipher by
means of Differential Cryptanalysis. To this end, we lay down some background
knowledge in the fields of Probability Theory, Boolean Algebra and Block
Ciphers themselves first, along with examples and the necessary mathematical
theorems. We then move on to explaining what Differential Cryptanalysis is, how
it works, and how we can use it against Substitution-Permutation Networks. We
conclude with a walkthrough of the process by means of an example.

\Large \bf Abstract
\end{center}

We begin by discussing basic Probability Theory, along with Block
Ciphers and Differential Properties of S-Boxes. We then move
on to explaining how a Differential Attack works, and the 
properties of involved that make it work. Furthermore, we include
and implemented case of a Block Cipher break.

Brief description of your project, i.e., say what you're going to
do.  Something like ``We describe Manuel Blum's protocol for coin
flipping over the telephone, filling in a bunch of number
theoretic background''.

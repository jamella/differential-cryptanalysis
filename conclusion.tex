\chapter{Conclusion} \label{c:conclusion}

Thus, we can see that the basic structure of Block Cipher, and in particular a
Substitution-Permutation Network, can be broken with relative ease using
Differential Cryptanalysis. Fortunately, there have been numerous improvements
made to this simple structure, resulting in ciphers, such as AES, that are
impervious to Differential Cryptanalysis. However, the mechanics behind creating
a strong Block Cipher are well beyond the scope of our discussion.

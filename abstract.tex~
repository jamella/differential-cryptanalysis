\Large \bf Abstract
\end{center}

We begin by discussing basic Finite Field theory, along with a 
discussion of concepts required to define Rijndael. We then move
on to explaining how Rijndael works, and the properties of it 
that make it exceptionally difficult to break using Differential
Cryptanalysis.

Brief description of your project, i.e., say what you're going to
do.  Something like ``We describe Manuel Blum's protocol for coin
flipping over the telephone, filling in a bunch of number
theoretic background''.
